## Open-Core Model
This project follows an *open-core* model:

- The base functionality of Open Letters is open-source and freely available under the GPL License. This includes features like OCR text extraction, letter categorization, reminders, and local data storage without any ads or analytics.
- The version of the app on the Google Play Store may include paid features, ads, analytics, and other premium services. These additional features are not included in the open-source version of the app.

The open-source version provides the core features necessary to digitize and organize your letters, while the Play Store version may offer enhanced functionality for users who prefer a paid experience.
